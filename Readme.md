# openclaw-sandbox image

This image contains an openclaw install on top of the [development image]. By default openclaw runs
as user and not root and is not able to change the `openclaw.json` config file by its own.

The default config file uses signal as channel and contains some environment variables for
configuration. Alternatively a customized `openclaw.json` can be mounted in the container.

## Installation

1. Pull from [Docker Hub], download the package from [Releases] or build using `builder/build.sh`
